# Distribution-fitting-R
Distribution fitting is useful for the tasks such as risk measurement. In this project, I used R fitdistrplus package to fit some families of distributions to some randomly generated data. Please note that this is a parametric analysis. Also, I obtained CI for parameters of the model using bootstraping. After fitting distributions, its time for measuring goodness-of-fits. There are severam methods to compare different distributions and picking the best family.
